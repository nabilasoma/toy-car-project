            <h3 className='text-green-600 mt-12 text-xl font-bold text-center mb-8'>Question No-1: What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?</h3>
            <h3 className='text-center'>Answer: An access token and a refresh token are commonly used in authentication and authorization systems. Here's an explanation of what they are, how they work, and where they should be stored on the client-side:<br />

<span className='text-red-600 font-bold'>Access Token</span>:<br />

An access token is a credential that represents the authorization granted to a client (user or application) to access protected resources.
It is typically a string of characters generated by the server upon successful authentication.
The access token is included in the headers or as a parameter in API requests to authenticate and authorize the client to access specific resources or perform certain actions.
Access tokens are usually short-lived and have an expiration time.<br />

<span className='text-red-600 font-bold'>Refresh Token:</span><br/>

A refresh token is a long-lived credential that is used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires.
It is issued alongside the access token during the authentication process and is stored securely on the client-side.
Refresh tokens are typically not exposed to API requests but are exchanged with the server behind the scenes to obtain a fresh access token.
How they work together:

If the access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to request a new access token without requiring the user to reauthenticate.
The server validates the refresh token and, if valid, issues a new access token, allowing the client to continue accessing protected resources.
Storage on the client-side:

Access tokens are usually stored in memory (e.g., JavaScript variables) since they are short-lived and used frequently in API requests.
Refresh tokens, being long-lived and sensitive, need to be stored securely.
Common practices for storing refresh tokens securely on the client-side include:
Storing them in an HTTP-only cookie, which helps protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

<h3 className='text-green-600 mt-12 text-xl font-bold text-center mb-8'>Question No-2: Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?</h3>
<h3 className='text-center'>Answer: </h3>
<p className='text-center mt-2'>SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) databases are two different types of database management systems. Here's a comparison between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL Databases:

Structure: SQL databases are based on a structured schema, typically using tables with predefined columns and relationships between them.
Data Model: SQL databases follow the relational data model, where data is organized into tables with rows and columns.
Query Language: SQL databases use SQL as the query language to perform operations like selecting, inserting, updating, and deleting data.
Scalability: SQL databases usually scale vertically, meaning they handle increased workload by adding more powerful hardware resources to a single server.
ACID Compliance: SQL databases emphasize ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure data integrity and transactional consistency.
Use Cases: SQL databases are suitable for applications that require complex querying, strong consistency, and well-defined relationships between entities, such as financial systems, inventory management, or content management systems.
NoSQL Databases:

Structure: NoSQL databases have a flexible schema or schema-less design, allowing for dynamic changes to data structure without predefined tables and columns.
Data Model: NoSQL databases support various data models like key-value pairs, documents, columnar, and graph structures, depending on the database type (e.g., document-oriented, key-value store, columnar store, graph database).
Query Language: NoSQL databases may provide their own query languages specific to their data models, but many also support APIs and query methods.

<h3 className='text-bold text-red-500 text-center'>Answer</h3>
<p className='text-center'>
Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features and tools for building web applications and APIs. Express.js simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware implementation. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a popular choice for developers to create server-side applications in JavaScript.

Key features of Express.js include:

Routing: Express.js allows you to define routes and handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to specific endpoints.

RESTful API Development: Express.js is commonly used to build RESTful APIs, as it provides the necessary tools and flexibility to handle different HTTP methods and route patterns.
Key features of Nest.js include:

TypeScript Support: Nest.js is built with TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript. It brings static typing and other features from TypeScript to Node.js development, enhancing code quality and developer productivity.

Modular Architecture: Nest.js encourages a modular design pattern, where applications are composed of modules, each containing controllers, services, and other components. This modular approach promotes code organization, reusability, and separation of concerns.
.

Scalability and Performance: Nest.js is designed to handle large-scale applications efficiently. It offers support for async/await, advanced caching mechanisms, and fine-grained control over request handling and middleware execution.

Overall, Nest.js builds upon the features of Express.js while providing additional capabilities and architectural patterns for building robust server-side applications with TypeScript. It aims to enhance developer productivity and maintainability by providing a structured and opinionated framework.</p>
<h3 className='text-green-600 mt-12 text-xl font-bold text-center mb-8'>Question No-4: What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work</h3>
<h3 className='font-bold text-center text-red-500'>Answer:</h3>
<p className='text-center'>Aggregation is a way of processing a large number of documents in a collection by means of passing them through different stages. The stages make up what is known as a pipeline. The stages in a pipeline can filter, sort, group, reshape and modify documents that pass through the pipeline. In MongoDB, the aggregate method is used to perform advanced data aggregation operations on collections. It allows you to process and transform data in a flexible and powerful way, combining multiple stages to produce the desired results. The aggregation framework in MongoDB provides a pipeline-based approach where documents flow through various stages to undergo different transformations and computations.</p>
